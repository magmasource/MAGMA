# MELTS software #

**MELTS** is a software package designed to facilitate thermodynamic modeling of phase equilibria in magmatic systems. It provides the ability to compute equilibrium phase relations for igneous systems over the temperature range 500-2000 Â°C and the pressure range 0-2 GPa.

This repository is a fork of the **MAGMA** branch of Mark Ghiorso's **[xMELTS](https://gitlab.com/ENKI-portal/xMELTS)** repository on GitLab. It is maintained by Paula Antoshechkina and includes edits made for the [MAGMA@Caltech](magmasource.caltech.edu) effort (including early work on [MELTS for MATLAB](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018AGUFMED44B..23A%2F/abstract)) and for the [Magma Chamber Simulator](https://mcs.geol.ucsb.edu/) ([MCS](https://mcs.geol.ucsb.edu/)). Melts-batch executables for MacOS, Windows and Linux, like those used by the MCS, can be found in the MCS-Melts-batch and Linux-Melts-batch directories.

In this repository the original standalone rhyolite-MELTS (v 1.0.2, 1.1.x, 1.2.x) and pMELTS (v 5.6.1) graphical user interface (GUI) is replaced by Einari Suikkanen's easyMelts software, which has the same capabilities - plus working plots - in a modern and easy-to-use package.

For additional documentation on the original GUI, visit the [MELTS website](http://melts.ofm-research.org/index.html). There you can find preconfigured executables for MacOS and Ubuntu platforms (though your mileage may vary, especially with the Linux ones).

## Downloading and running the software (MacOS, Linux or Windows) ##

easyMelts is a GUI application for running MELTS on Windows, macOS and Linux. easyMelts is designed to be an approachable alternative for the more advanced tools in the MELTS family. Feature-wise, easyMelts is comparable to the the original GUI MELTS.

easyMelts will be posted here soon, but in the meantime it can be downloaded from the [MAGMA Source GitList server](https://magmasource.caltech.edu/gitlist/easyMelts.git/). No installation is requied (though it helps to put the easyMelts executable somewhere in your path). For instructions on how to run the software see the README.

Melts-batch will also be formally released, with version numbers, soon. In the meantime, it should be possible to run the binaries in the MCS-Melts-batch and Linux-Melts-batch folders as-is. Download the Melts-batch.zip file or Melts-batch.exe.zip file and make sure to expand it.
