Purpose of software and contact:

easyMelts was created by Einari Suikkanen for thermodynamic modeling of phase equilibria using the MELTS engine by Mark S. Ghiorso. It is now maintained and developed by Paula Antoshechkina. easyMelts is in no way associated to or endorsed by the author(s) or copyright holder(s) of MELTS or their associates.

easyMelts is essentially a graphical user interface built on the MELTS C-library, with some modifications to allow it to be open source (specifically replacement of routines from Numerical Recipes with alternatives from the GNU Scientific Library). It should produce near-identical results to the original MELTS GUI application OR Melts-batch and its derivatives.

While not technically part of the license requirements, we request that any publication using this software includes modified source code or a clear text explanation of any changes made that may affect model results. This may also be a requirement of the journal publisher.

    THE SOFTWARE.

This Milo Yip DTOA library (emyg_dtoa) is used to avoid issues where the
standard sprintf() dtoa function changes output based on locale settings. It
is also 40-50% faster than the standard dtoa for raw numeric data. The use of
this library is optional. If you wish to use it you can pass
`USE_DTOA_LIBRARY=1` to make when compiling.

    In case this attempt to disclaim copyright and place the software in the

    There's ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY, express or implied.

    (This is a heavily cut-down "BSD license".)

Note, the MD5 library is used to avoid including duplicate image files in the
xlsx file. If you don't want to use this code, and the additional licence, you
can use OpenSSL's MD5 functions instead by passing `USE_OPENSSL_MD5=1` to
make. If this functionality isn't required it is possible to compile
libxlsxwriter without image deduplication by passing `USE_NO_MD5=1` to make.
